# parc
A parser compiler

This is a prototype I wrote a while back to learn and test things out. It can takes a set of production rules are creates the NFA representation of these production rules. It then proceeeds to create a DFA from the NFA. You can follow the progress as the changes update in real time. Useful for learning purposes.
