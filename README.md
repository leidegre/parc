# parc
A parser compiler

This is a prototype I wrote in C# a while back to learn more about compiler construction and test things out. It can take a set of production rules and visualize the NFA representation of these production rules. It then proceeeds to create the DFA from the NFA (and visualize that to). You can follow the progress as the changes update in real time. Useful for learning purposes.
